        Outside of the world of coding, I find joy and creative expression through digital art. It's a realm where I can let my imagination run wild,
        experimenting with colors, shapes, and visual storytelling. Whether it's creating vibrant illustrations or diving into more intricate digital paintings, I relish
        the process of bringing my ideas to fruition. This artistic side of me provides a welcome balance to the logical and analytical nature of coding, and
        it's in this fusion of creativity and technology that I discover a sense of fulfillment and self-expression.

        I'm also enthusiastic about the world of competitive fighting games. The fast-paced, strategic battles in
        these games fuel my competitive spirit and keep me engaged in the gaming community. Whether I'm mastering combos, analyzing opponents' strategies, or
        participating in tournaments, the world of competitive gaming offers a thrilling and dynamic experience that challenges both my reflexes and strategic
        thinking. Much like coding, competitive gaming demands focus, discipline, and a constant drive to improve, making it an exhilarating complement to my
        technical pursuits.
      </p>
      <p class="font-general-regular mb-4 text-ternary-dark dark:text-ternary-light text-lg">
        These two facets of my life, digital art, and competitive gaming, provide a well-rounded perspective and inspire me to continue
        exploring the boundaries of creativity and skill in both the digital and gaming realms.

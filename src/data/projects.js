		objectives1: 'My objective for this project was to create a dynamic and user-friendly full-stack application using modern technologies like TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. The goal was to offer Valorant enthusiasts a convenient and efficient way to access up-to-date game information from the unofficial Valorant API. I aimed to eliminate the need for players to download the game, scour through YouTube videos, search for online articles, or wait for large patches to experience new content firsthand.',
		objectives2:'To achieve this, I designed a robust navigation system using React Router, enabling users to easily share and access specific character or weapon details through dynamically generated URLs. Additionally, I wanted to showcase my problem-solving skills by developing custom functions to efficiently process API data, ensuring a user-friendly experience.',
		challenges1: 'This application was very first web application built with pure HTML, CSS, and ES5 JavaScript with step-by-step AJAX methods. I came back to revamp this project and modernize it by  from a basic HTML, CSS, and ES5 JavaScript structure to a modern ES6 JavaScript, React, and TypeScript architecture. This transition required a thorough understanding of the principles behind these technologies and the ability to refactor existing code effectively.',
		challenges2: 'Additionally, ensuring seamless navigation within the application posed its own set of challenges. Designing a dynamic URL generation system with React Router required meticulous planning and implementation to provide users with an intuitive and efficient way to access specific game content. Despite these challenges, the project ultimately proved to be a valuable learning experience, allowing me to showcase my adaptability and growth as a developer. It reinforced the importance of staying up-to-date with modern coding practices and the satisfaction of delivering a polished, user-centric application.',

		objectives1: "The primary goal of this project was to create a dynamic, full-stack web application using modern technologies. I aimed to build a user-friendly platform that leverages the official Marvel Comics API, enabling users to search for and favorite various Marvel characters. To achieve this, I focused on the frontend, employing React, React Router, and React Hook Form for an interactive and efficient user interface. Additionally, I utilized Axios for handling HTTP requests and Multer for seamless file uploads.",
		objectives2: "This project served as the final milestone in my web development program, encapsulating the culmination of my learning journey. Over the course of one week, I dedicated myself to in-depth research on the chosen technologies and independently implemented them. The key objective was to create a functional and secure web application that not only met the requirements but also demonstrated my proficiency in web development. One of the highlights of this project was the integration of user authentication and authorization mechanisms powered by JSON Web Tokens and Argon2 password hashing. The end goal was to present this application not only to my class but also to a broader audience within the institution, showcasing my growth and skills as a web developer.",
		challenges1: "Developing this dynamic web application posed several challenges, particularly in integrating various technologies seamlessly. One notable hurdle was the coordination between the frontend and backend components to ensure smooth data flow and user interactions. This required a deep understanding of React, React Router, and state management, as well as effective communication between frontend and backend using Axios for HTTP requests. Additionally, implementing user authentication and authorization with JSON Web Tokens and Argon2 password hashing demanded rigorous attention to security practices, ensuring user data remained protected.",
		challenges2: "The time constraint of one week for this final project presented its own set of challenges. The compressed timeline required intensive research, rapid decision-making, and efficient implementation. Learning and applying new technologies, such as Multer for file uploads and pg as the PostgreSQL client library, within this timeframe was a demanding task. Moreover, creating a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing frontend with Tailwind CSS while ensuring it seamlessly interacted with the backend was a challenge in design and development synchronization. Despite these challenges, the project served as a valuable test of my ability to learn and adapt quickly, which is a crucial skill in the ever-evolving field of web development.",

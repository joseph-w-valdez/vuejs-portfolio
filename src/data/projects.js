		objectives1: 'My objective for this project was to create a dynamic and user-friendly full-stack application using modern technologies like TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. The goal was to offer Valorant enthusiasts a convenient and efficient way to access up-to-date game information from the unofficial Valorant API. I aimed to eliminate the need for players to download the game, scour through YouTube videos, search for online articles, or wait for large patches to experience new content firsthand.',
		objectives2:'To achieve this, I designed a robust navigation system using React Router, enabling users to easily share and access specific character or weapon details through dynamically generated URLs. Additionally, I wanted to showcase my problem-solving skills by developing custom functions to efficiently process API data, ensuring a user-friendly experience.',
		challenges1: 'This application was very first web application built with pure HTML, CSS, and ES5 JavaScript with step-by-step AJAX methods. I came back to revamp this project and modernize it by  from a basic HTML, CSS, and ES5 JavaScript structure to a modern ES6 JavaScript, React, and TypeScript architecture. This transition required a thorough understanding of the principles behind these technologies and the ability to refactor existing code effectively.',
		challenges2: 'Additionally, ensuring seamless navigation within the application posed its own set of challenges. Designing a dynamic URL generation system with React Router required meticulous planning and implementation to provide users with an intuitive and efficient way to access specific game content. Despite these challenges, the project ultimately proved to be a valuable learning experience, allowing me to showcase my adaptability and growth as a developer. It reinforced the importance of staying up-to-date with modern coding practices and the satisfaction of delivering a polished, user-centric application.',

		objectives1: "In this project, I created a tailored web application that prominently showcases their eye clinic's location, staff, services, mission, and easy contact options. My primary aim was to not only meet their requested specifications but to also exceed their expectations. I developed a dynamic and feature-rich platform using cutting-edge technologies such as TypeScript, React, and Next.js 13. A key aspect of this objective was establishing a strong client relationship, ensuring open communication, and actively involving them in the development process for both design and features.",
		objectives2: "The key tenets revolved around three core pillars: user experience, performance, and functionality. I dedicated my efforts to designing an intuitive and visually appealing interface that ensured a seamless experience for users, helping them easily understand the clinic's capabilities, services, and how to locate their clinic and surgery centers. Scalability was a top priority, enabling the platform to accommodate growth and future maintenance needs.",
		challenges1: "Throughout this project was to harmonize the web application with the clinic's vision by consistently updating content to align with their specific requirements and preferences. This entailed frequent coordination with the clinic's team to incorporate new information, service updates, and alterations in locations or contact details. The challenge extended beyond mere updates; it encompassed preserving the quality and cohesiveness of the application while swiftly adapting to evolving client expectations. Successfully addressing this challenge emphasized the significance of efficient content management systems and an adaptable development approach capable of accommodating the clinic's ever-changing needs.",
